# Script to translate the C-style comments (//) of a source file, with the aid from an external translation service, like Google Translate
#
# Steps to translate the comments of a source file:
#
# 1. Translate the file in Google Translate or other translation service
# 2. Copy the result of the translation to a new file
# 3. Check that there are no extra or removed lines. If so, align the original and translated files
# 4. Only one-line comments are supported. If there are blocks with C-style comments, preceed the comments in these lines with //
# 5. Execute:
#		translate_comments.sh original_file translated_file
#
# This will keep the code and everything as in the original file, and only the comments from the translated file
